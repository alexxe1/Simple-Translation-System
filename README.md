# Simple Translation System
A simple asset for implementing translation, based on .csv files, for your [Unity](https://unity.com/) game.

## How does it work?
- **Simple Translation System** works using `.csv (Comma Separated Values)` files. `.csv` is a pretty convenient file type that separates spreadsheet values using `;`. The idea of this asset is pretty straightforward, you first get the raw data, then convert it to a string array and, finally, retrieve it using a unique ID.

## How to use
0. Create your `.csv` file using [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/), [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/es-ar/microsoft-365/excel) or any other spreadsheet software. 
Make sure to format it using this convention:

```
id;lang1;lang2;lang3...
```

For example:

```
welcome;Hola;Hello
quit;Â¡Adios!;Goodbye!
...
```

> A .csv example can be found in the repository.

1. Drag the `TranslationSystem` script to a GameObject.
2. Drag your `.csv` to the `Raw Data` slot.
3. Configure the script (hover your mouse over each setting to see more information).
4. Add your languages (must be the same names and order as your .csv file).
5. Create a script that retrieves the translations, like this:

```
public class ExampleItem : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("References")] 
    private TMP_Text textToApply;
    
    [Header("Settings")] 
    [SerializeField] private string itemId;

    private void Awake()
    {
        textToApply = GetComponent<TMP_Text>();
    }

    private void Start()
    {
        UpdateText();
    }
        
    private void UpdateText()
    {
        textToApply.text = TranslationSystem.Instance.GetTranslation(itemId);
    }
}
```

> **NOTE:** This code assumes you've checked the `singleton` box.

## Important
- After setting a new language, prompt the user to restart your game so changes take effect.

- When creating your `.csv` file, make sure not to include `new lines` or `semicolons` directly. 
Instead, use `<newline>` and `<semicolon>`.

For example:<br/>
```The pancakes were delicious<semicolon> they were fluffy and sweet.```
<br/>or<br/>
```This is the first line.<newline>This is a new line.```

## Inspector Settings
| Setting name | Description                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `Raw data` | The .csv file to extract the data from. |
| `Debug mode` | Enables the debug mode. |
| `Singleton` | If enabled, TranslationSystem will behave as a Singleton. |
| `AutoLoadPreferredLanguage` | Automatically loads the preferred language from the PlayerPrefs. Disabling this requires calling 'LoadPreferredLanguage' method manually. |
| `PreferredLanguagePath` | The path where the preferred translation will be stored in PlayerPrefs. Leave blank for default ('preferred_language'). | 
| `AvailableLanguages` | The list with all available languages. |

## Methods
| Function name | Parameters| Description                    |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `SetLanguage`  | `string newLang` | Sets the current language to a new one. If two languages have the same ID, the function will assign the first one to appear on the list. TranslationSystem will automatically save the preferred language in PlayerPrefs.     |
| `GetTranslation` | `string itemId` | Returns the corresponding translation depending on the selected language.|
| `GetCurrentLanguage` | | Returns the current language as a `Language` class. |
| `GetAvailableLanguages` | | Returns all available languages as an array of 'Language' class. |
| `GetCurrentSavePath` | | Returns the current save path used in PlayerPrefs. |
| `LoadPreferredLanguage` | | Loads the preferred language stored in the save path (can be modified in settings). If `autoLoadPreferredLanguage` option is enabled, this will be called automatically when starting. |
